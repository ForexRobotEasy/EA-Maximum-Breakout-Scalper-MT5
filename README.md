# EA Maximum Breakout Scalper MT5

This is a Forex Expert Advisor (EA) developed by the Forex Robot Easy Team. The EA is designed to trade breakouts in the Forex market on the MetaTrader 5 platform. It aims to take advantage of high price fluctuations to generate profits.

## Features

## How it works

The EA operates based on two modes: manual trading and automated trading.

In manual trading mode, the EA allows traders to execute their own trades. Traders can use their preferred trading strategies and indicators.

In automated trading mode, the EA takes control and trades automatically. It checks for high price fluctuations on the H1 timeframe and places pending orders accordingly. The EA uses a complex mathematical algorithm to identify high price fluctuations. If a new bar has formed and high price fluctuations are detected, the EA places pending orders with the specified lot size, risk percentage, stop loss, and take profit levels. Trailing stop functionality can also be enabled.
